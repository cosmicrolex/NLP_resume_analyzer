AI-Powered Job Assistant
This project is a job description and resume analyzer that takes inputs of job descriptions from recruiters and resumes from candidates, analyzes the text using TF-IDF and cosine similarity for matching, and provides AI-powered insights to improve resumes. It uses a FastAPI backend for processing and a Streamlit frontend for user interaction.

Configured FastAPI to display extracted text in JSON format in the browser.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Virtual environment
OpenAI API key (stored in backend/.env)

Setup Instructions

▶️Clone the repository:
>>git clone <repository-url>

▶️Create and activate a virtual environment:
>>python -m venv virtualenvironment
>>cd .\AI-Powered-Job-Assistant\virtualenvironment\Scripts\
.\activate

▶️Install dependencies:
go to root directory by doing cd../.. and make sure the env is active
Run:pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️Navigate to backend/ and install backend-specific dependencies:cd .\AI-Powered-Job-Assistant\backend\
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️Create a .env file in backend/ with your OpenAI API key:OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

▶️Place a sample PDF resume in backend/utils/ for testing.

:::::::::::::::::::Running the Backend:::::::::::::

▶️️️️Navigate to the backend app directory:cd .\AI-Powered-Job-Assistant\backend\

▶️Start the FastAPI server:
>>uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Access the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

:::::::::::::Running the Frontend:::::::::::::

▶️Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:cd .\AI-Powered-Job-Assistant\frontend

▶️Start the Streamlit app:
>>streamlit run streamlit_app.py

Access the frontend at http://localhost:8501.

Testing the API

Analyze Resume:
curl.exe -X POST -F "file=@path\to\your_resume.pdf" http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze-resume/

In Postman, select POST, set the endpoint to http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze-resume/, choose form-data, set key as file, and upload the PDF.
Response includes extracted text, TF-IDF analysis, and AI insights.

Match Resume with Job Description:
curl.exe -X POST -F "file=@path\to\your_resume.pdf" -F "job_description=your job description text" http://127.0.0.1:8000/match-resume-job/

In Postman, add job_description as a form-data key with the text value.

Match Resume with Job Description PDF:
curl.exe -X POST -F "file=@path\to\your_resume.pdf" -F "jd_file=@path\to\your_job_description.pdf" http://127.0.0.1:8000/match-resume-job-pdf/

Features

PDF Text Extraction: Extracts text from resume and job description PDFs.
TF-IDF Analysis: Identifies key terms and their importance in resumes and job descriptions.
Cosine Similarity: Measures compatibility between resumes and job descriptions.
AI Insights: Uses OpenAI's API to identify resume deficiencies (e.g., missing skills, extracurriculars) and provide tailored improvement suggestions.
Streamlit Frontend: User-friendly interface with dark/light mode, displaying analysis results and AI insights.

Notes

Ensure the PDF file names match those used in API calls.
The .env file should not be committed to version control; add it to .gitignore.
For alternative AI models (e.g., Grok, Gemini), update ai_analyzer.py with the respective API client and endpoint.
